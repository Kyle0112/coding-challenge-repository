Problem Set 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence

Problem Description
The Longest Increasing Subsequence problem involves finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an unsorted array of integers. Given an array, the task is to determine the longest subsequence where the elements are sorted in strictly increasing order.

Solution Overview
The solution to the Longest Increasing Subsequence problem typically employs dynamic programming techniques. I iterate through the array, maintaining an array to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element. By continually updating this array, I can now determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence for the entire array.

Instructions to Run the Code
