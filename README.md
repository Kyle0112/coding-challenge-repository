Coding Challenges Overview
This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges:

1. Longest Increasing Subsequence: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
2. Palindrome Pairs: Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices in the list so that the concatenation of the two words forms a palindrome.
3. Valid Parentheses: Given a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']'), determine if the input string is valid.

Overview
1. Longest Increasing Subsequence
The Longest Increasing Subsequence problem involves finding the length of the longest subsequence in an array where elements are in strictly increasing order.

2. Palindrome Pairs
The Palindrome Pairs problem requires finding all pairs of distinct indices in a list of words such that the concatenation of the two words forms a palindrome.

3. Valid Parentheses
The Valid Parentheses problem involves determining whether a given string containing only parentheses is valid according to certain rules.

Implementation
-Each solution is implemented using efficient algorithms and data structures suitable for the problem.
-Additional test cases are included to verify the correctness and efficiency of the solutions.

Instructions
1. Cloning the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Select a Problem: Choose the problem you want to run solutions for.
4. Compile and Run: Depending on the language used for implementation (Go, Node.js, etc.), compile or run the solution file using the appropriate command.
5. Review the Output: The program will output the result of the solution, whether it's the length of the longest increasing subsequence, pairs of indices forming palindromes,or the validity of the parentheses string.

Additional Notes
-Ensure that you have the necessary programming language installed on your system to run the solutions.
-Customize the solutions or add more test cases as needed to test different scenarios.
